# Preconfigured starter code files for all CSV/parquet/geojson datasets of {{ PROVIDER }}

### Open any tabular or geojson dataset of **{{ PROVIDER }}** with one click and **get a fully configured Python Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file**. 

- The code files are **set with relevant metadata, descriptions, data links, and some starter code.** 
- The idea of this experiment is **that you immediately can start analyzing the data with R or Python.** 
- You can **open the Python notebooks with one click in Google Colab too.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To **download individual files from GitHub you need to switch to the file's `RAW` view and then `Right-Click-Save-As`.** Only so you get the proper file format rather than the HTML that GitHub yields.

Feedback is always very welcome ‚Äì simply open an issue.

üëâ Here is the link to the [repository]({{ GITHUB_REPO }}) that contains currently 2 x {{ DATASET_COUNT }} code files (1 x R, 1 x Python) for all data sets (*¬´resources¬ª*) that are available on [{{ PROVIDER }}]({{ DATA_PORTAL }}) and that contain  CSV, parquet or geojson files. This website is build from this repo.
