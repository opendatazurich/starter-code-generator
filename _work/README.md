# Preconfigured starter code files for all CSV/parquet/geojson datasets of OpenDataZurich

### Open any tabular or geojson dataset of OpenDataZurich with one click and get a fully configured Python Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file. 

### Please go to this 👉 **[overview website](https://opendatazurich.github.io/starter-code/) with the full list of datasets and links to all code files**. 

This repository provides currently 2 x 20 code files (1 x R, 1 x Python) for all data sets (*«resources»*) that are available on [OpenDataZurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) and that contain one or several CSV/parquet/geojson distributions.

- The code files are set with relevant metadata, descriptions, data links, and some starter code. 
- The idea of this experiment is **that you immediately can start analyzing the data with R or Python.** 
- You can **open the Python notebooks with one click in Google Colab too.**

⚠️ **Note**: 
- **GitHub unfortunately doesn't render larger markdown files full length in the repo view.** The GitHub page aka «overview website» (link above) renders the list properly. 
- Unfortunately you neither won't be able to view all 2.k+ files in the repo folders. Again GitHub truncates file lists longer than 1k files. Files beyond the limit are available but aren't listed. So either clone the repo or select individual files from the [overview website](https://opendatazurich.github.io/starter-code/).


Feedback is always very welcome – simply open an issue! 🙌
